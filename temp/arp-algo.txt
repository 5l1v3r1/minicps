Arp_check(event):
	if !(ARP_OK):
		tag the packets to be sent to the controller
		sign the packet in some way
		send the packet to the controller
		send the packet to IDS monitoring
	else if (there_is_mapping):
		forward the packet to the mapped port
	else:
		send the packet to the controller
		
Arp_handler:
	if (packet tagged arp spoofed):
		if (signature_ok):
			countermeasure()
		else:
			pass


ARP_OK check:
	

Countermeasures:
	close the connection with the percieved MAC attacker
	forward packet to a well known port (IDS listening on it)
	scan the attacker host for malaware (from the controller)
	alert the admin
	
	
		
Pros:
	prevent cumulative ARP poisoning from the same node (no DoS)
	single time delay for every new attaccker node
	
More:
	active vs passive ARP poisoning mgmt
	not all OpenFlow switches support TLS for OF auth

Other OpenFlow attacks:
	who is the controller attacks: DNS spoofing, controller DoS
