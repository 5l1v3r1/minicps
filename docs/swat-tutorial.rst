General View
=============

This tutorial shows hot to use MiniCPS to simulate a part of a real water
Threatment testbed. The testbed is called *SWaT* that stands for *Secure Water
Threatment* and it is used by SUTD (Singapore University of Technology and
Design) researcher as students in the context of Cyber-physical systems
security.

Process and Control Strategy
----------------------------

The simulation focuses on the first subprocess of the SWaT testbed. In normal
operating conditions the water flows into a Raw water tank (T101) passing through a
flow level sensors (FIT101) and an open motorized valve (MV101). T101 has a
water level indicator (LIT101) able to measure the quantity of water inside
the tank. A pump (P101) [#]_ is able to move the water to the next stage.

The whole subprocess is controlled by a set of *PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers)*
``plc1`` reads 

.. [#] The real system uses two redundant pumps, one is working and the other
       is in stand-by mode.
